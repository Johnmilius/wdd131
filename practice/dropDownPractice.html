    <h1>Best Places To Surf!</h1>

    <button class="accordion">Pipeline, Oahu, Hawaii</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Location: North Shore, Oahu</p>
        <p>Wave Type: Reef break</p>
        <p> Pipeline is one of the most famous surf spots in the world, located on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii. The
            wave here is known for its powerful barrels that form over a shallow reef, creating hollow waves that are
            perfect for experienced surfers looking for a challenge. The wave can break anywhere from 6 feet to 20+ feet
            during the winter months, making it a top destination for big wave surfers. It’s often considered a proving
            ground for professional surfers, hosting the annual Billabong Pipeline Masters event as part of the World
            Surf League championship tour.</p>

    <button class="accordion"> Jeffrey's Bay, South Africa</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Location: Eastern Cape, South Africa</p>

        <p>Wave Type: Point break</p>
        <p>
            Jeffrey’s Bay is globally recognized for its long, fast, and incredibly smooth right-hand point breaks. It’s
            a top destination for surfers seeking consistent, world-class waves. The bay’s distinctive geography creates
            one of the longest rides in the world, with waves sometimes stretching over 300 meters. The spot is known
            for being particularly favorable in the Southern Hemisphere’s winter months, with waves often reaching
            overhead size. The area also hosts the World Surf League's J-Bay Open, attracting top-tier surfers and fans

    <button class="accordion">Teahupo'o, Tahiti</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Location: Island of Tahiti, French Polynesia </p>

        <p>Wave Type: Reef break</p>

        <p>
            Teahupo’o is infamous for having some of the thickest and heaviest waves on the planet. The reef break here
            creates powerful, fast barrels that can be daunting even for the most experienced surfers. What makes
            Teahupo’o unique is the way the wave breaks—closer to the shore than most other spots, over a shallow reef,
            creating massive, hollow tubes. It’s renowned for its extreme conditions, which makes it a mecca for
            big-wave surfers seeking a thrilling, world-class challenge. The spot is also known for its stunning beauty,
            with turquoise waters and dramatic tropical scenery.
